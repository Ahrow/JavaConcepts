# **Learning Outcomes 1, 2, and 5**

_LO 1_Introduction to Linear and non-linear data structures:_

**Problem 1: Array Data Structures:**

    S = [10, 7, 11, 5, 13, 8, 38, 37, 14, 92, 84, 74, 77, 20, 40, 47, 33, 65, 62, 69, 73]

**Problem 1.1:**

    • Search two elements, i.e., x = 10, y = 84, z = 73, and w = 120 in this array. 
    • What is the time complexity for searching x, y, z, and w? You can find some guidance here to measure the execution time of the algorithm.

**Problem 1.2:**

    • Reverse Traverse the array (from N to 0).

**Problem 1.3: Insert an element in an array:**

    • At the starting array index
    • At the ending array index
    • At any random array index

**Problem 1.4: Delete an element in an array:**

    • At the starting array index
    • At the ending array index
    • At any random array index

**Problem 2: Linked List Data structures:**

    Insert an element using:

    • Singly linked list
    • Doubly linked list
    • Circular singly linked list
    • Circular doubly linked list

**o Problem 3: Stack Data structures:**

    • Implement push operation of the stack in java
    • Implement pop operation of the stack in java

**Problem 4: Queue Data structures:**

**Problem 4.1:**

    • Insert an element in simple/linear queue using array data structure
    • Insert an element in simple/linear queue using linked list data structure
    • Delete an element in simple/linear queue using array data structure
    • Delete an element in simple/linear queue using linked list data structure

**Problem 4.2:**

    • Check the palindrome (“MADAM”) using Deque (or, Double Ended Queue).

## LO 2_Searching Algorithms:

In this Practice, you will use the Basic World Cities Database. It can be downloaded for free from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
**Problem 1: Linear Search of a list**

    • Use the latitude values of every city.
    • Implement a linear search on a list of the latitude values. It should be possible to input the latitude, and the corresponding city, if it exists, should be printed.
    • Measure the execution time for your algorithm. You can find some guidance here.
**Problem 2: Binary Search of an ordered list**

    • Use the unique latitude values of each city only.
    • Implement a binary search on an ordered list of the latitude values. It should be possible to input the latitude, and the corresponding city, if it exists, should be printed.
    • Measure the execution time for your algorithm. You can find some guidance here. Justify which algorithm is more efficient. Linear Search or Binary Search?
**Problem 3: Binary Search Tree**

    • Problem 3.1: Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversals – In-order, Pre-order, Post-order
    • Problem 3.2: Search x = 7 and y = 20 in the given Binary Search Tree
    • Problem 3.3: Insert x =20 in the given Binary Search Tree
    • Problem 3.4: Deletion in Binary Search Tree
    
    o Delete x = 4 in the given Binary Search Tree
    o Delete x = 14 in the given Binary Search Tree
    o Delete x = 8 in the given Binary Search Tree

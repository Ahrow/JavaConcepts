Objective: Create a Java program that manages a collection of Book objects.
Your program should be able to add new books, display all books, and search for books by title.

Requirements:

Book Class:
----------
Attributes: Create the following attributes:
title (String)
author (String)
price (double)
isbn (int)
Constructor: Define a constructor that initializes all attributes.
Getters/Setters: Implement getter and setter methods for all attributes.

Library Class:
--------------
Attributes: Create the following attributes:
books (an array of Book objects)
count (int) to keep track of the actual number of books in the array.
Methods:
addBook(Book book): Adds a new book to the books array and updates the count.
displayBooks(): Displays all books in the library. Use a for loop to iterate through the books array.
searchByTitle(String title): Searches for books by title. Print the details of all books that match the search query.

Main Class:
----------
In the Main class, write a main method to:
Instantiate the Library object.
Create several Book objects and add them to the Library.
Display all books in the library.
Search for a book by title.

Additional Instructions:
-----------------------
Ensure that your program handles cases where the books array might get filled. Consider expanding the array or simply limiting the input for this task.
Comment your code adequately to explain the logic wherever necessary.
